              <p>
                Hi, I'm Simon. <br />I'm a former web developer with 6 years
                experience working in digital agencies based on the Gold Coast.
                In 2014 I stepped away from the industry and moved to Whistler,
                Canada to do a ski season. As is a common story there, that
                "season" became 3 years... <strong>#noregrets</strong>

                I arrived back on the Gold Coast last year and have been working
                since October to re-acquaint myself with the industry and get up
                to speed on where web is at right now.

                <h3>WordPress Developer, Localsearch</h3>
                <small>Apr 2018 - Jun 2019</small>
                <p>
                  After a 3 year "Gap Year" living overseas in Whistler, Canada
                  I returned to web development, taking on a role at Localsearch
                  updating and maintaining old legacy client websites built on a
                  bespoke in-house CRM/CMS platform. Once my manager became
                  aware of my WordPress experience I was quickly utilised in
                  developing WooCommerce online stores, membership and directory
                  websites for clients as well as updating/maintaining/fixing
                  WordPress sites built by Localsearch' off-shore team.

                <h3>Web Developer, Sin Design + Branding</h3>
                <small>Mar 2012 - Jul 2014</small>
                <p>
                  Sin Design was a step away from the web agencies I'd been used
                  to. First and foremost a branding agency, their web department
                  was very fledgling. During my time there I learned a lot about
                  branding which I found really interesting, and also used the
                  opportunity to start learning the open source CMS platform
                  WordPress. When I started at Sin the evolution of front-end
                  development had really started to take off and I began
                  developing responsive websites utilising the new HTML5 and
                  CSS3 features that were making their way into modern browsers
                  in conjunction with jQuery.

                <p>
                  Graphics Online was a very similar role to New Business Media.
                  They managed their own in-house servers along with bespoke
                  software for managing client accounts with an integrated CMS
                  coupled with the system. In this role I gained some insight
                  into the workings of servers and the SysAdmin role.

                  I started my career as a junior developer at New Business
                  Media. Here I developed my HTML and CSS coding skills. I
                  learned the fundamentals of database driven website
                  development with PHP based CMS's and the process of taking a
                  design mock, coding it into a template and integrating it with
                  a CMS. The role also required the development of HTML email
                  newsletters, along with providing technical support for
                  clients and completing any website updates or maintenance
                  tasks.

              <p>
                I focus heavily on front-end development. The front-end world
                has evolved so rapidly over the last few years it's almost
                terrifying! But at the same time I find it so interesting and am
                excited by how far it's come and where it's heading (well, until
                my job is automated and I serve no purpose anyway...).
              </p>
              <p>
                I love diving into new workflow tools and trying the frameworks
                that seem to pop up every other week. The JAMStack is here and
                I'm really interested to see the changes it brings to the
                industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm also interested in online marketing and the genius ideas
                people come up with to utilise the internet to create passive
                income. When I was in Canada I developed my own private label
                product to sell on
                <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00SPGZ704">Amazon</a>. It
                was a really interesting learning experience and taught me a lot
                about PPC advertising and SEO.
              </p>
              <p>
                Travelling. I'm a big advocate of taking the plunge, leaving it
                all behind and getting out there and experiencing other walks of
                life and just <strong>#makingmemories</strong>.
